Insert into stripe_subscriptions Table:

    Find and select the stripe_subscriptions table in the list.
    Click the "+ Insert row" button.
    For the Pro User:
        customer_id: Enter the exact same fake ID you used for the Pro user in the stripe_customers table (e.g., cus_test_pro_123).
        price_id: Enter the Pro tier Price ID: price_1RJVcCPMCIlIT9KEUaR6HP2J
        status: Enter active. (Make sure this matches the exact value expected by your SubscriptionProvider or view logic if it's a custom type).
        Leave subscription_id, current_period_start, current_period_end, payment_method_brand, payment_method_last4, and deleted_at as NULL (empty). They aren't needed for the tier check.
        cancel_at_period_end should default to false, which is fine.
        created_at and updated_at should default to now(), which is fine.
        Click "Save".

        status: Enter active.
        Leave other optional fields (subscription_id, timestamps, etc.) as NULL.
